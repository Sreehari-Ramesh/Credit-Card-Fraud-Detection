# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a data analysis solution to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. With the increasing number of online transactions and the potential risks associated with credit card fraud, it has become crucial for financial institutions to implement robust fraud detection systems. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can accurately classify fraudulent transactions and aid in minimizing financial losses for both customers and financial institutions.

The main objective of this project is to develop a credit card fraud detection system that can automatically identify potentially fraudulent transactions. By employing advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to build a predictive model that can effectively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions, improving the security and trustworthiness of financial transactions.
